### Reflection


In this assignment, I gained hands-on experience with developing and securing REST APIs using FastAPI. Working on implementing JWT token-based OAuth2 authentication deepened my understanding of creating secure user authentication mechanisms. The importance of proper validation for user inputs was emphasized, as was handling edge cases in profile updates to ensure data integrity and security. These tasks provided a practical understanding of building robust and secure APIs, highlighting the necessity of thorough validation and error handling.

Collaborating using Git and GitHub was particularly enlightening. It underscored the significance of version control in managing a dynamic codebase, enabling efficient collaboration among multiple contributors. Creating branches, resolving issues, and conducting code reviews were instrumental in maintaining high code quality and fostering a collaborative development environment. Writing comprehensive tests using pytest ensured the application's reliability, improved my skills in testing APIs, and demonstrated the critical role of automated testing in delivering robust software solutions. This assignment significantly enhanced my technical skills and prepared me for real-world software development challenges.
